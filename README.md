### Heyo
I'm a software engineer that loves to learn, especially if it's a new language or technology.

### Online?
If you're coming from the web you'll likely get to know me as logdot.
My two claim's to fame in the cyberworld are:
- my contributions to the Highfleet modding scene, where I made [a mod](https://github.com/logdot/ShipworksExtended) and an [acompanying modloader](https://github.com/logdot/Highfleet-Modloader)
- my work as a team lead in the [hololife game](https://studiosmyles.itch.io/hololife)

If you need to contact me and are a netizen you can do so through discord at `Logdot#1577`

### Recruiter?
If you don't know me as logdot but instead as Timoteo Rider, you're probably a recruiter or hiring manager.
My github is entirely dedicated to personal projects, but I don't mind giving you a short tour to get you aquainted with the place.
I have a wide variety of project on my github, ranging from webapps and scripts through algorithms and reverse engineering.
I'll only give short explanations on select projects on this readme, you can get a more complete overview checking out [all my repos](https://github.com/logdot?tab=repositories).

If you need to contact me in a profesional setting please do so through `timoteo2.25+job@gmail.com`


#### [ZincSearch](https://github.com/logdot/zincSearch)
ZincSearch is currently my most recent project, made for a hiring challenge.
It's a simple webserver and indexer for the enron database written entirely in go for the backend and Vue for the frontend.
It uses ZincSearch as it's database (hence the name).

#### [Ftrace](https://github.com/logdot/FTrace)
Ftrace is a raytracing engine written entirely in F#.
It follows a book where it teaches you how to create a your own raytracing engine using TDD.
You're given unit tests, and you make the code that complies with them.

#### Highfleet
I've worked on a [modloader](https://github.com/logdot/Highfleet-Modloader) and [mod](https://github.com/logdot/ShipworksExtended) for the indie game [Highfleet](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1434950/HighFleet/).
These two projects are written entirely in C++.
The hardest part of this project is not actually the coding, but the reverse engineering, using [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), required to interface with the game.
This is because the game has almost no mod support, so any mods need to reverse engineer the game and change the game code directly.

And more, just check out [my repositories](https://github.com/logdot?tab=repositories).
